This is the Arrot Beauty Club.

It's so called 'Reservation System' with benefits like :

- Choose date and time for Services 
- Validators for specific date (IRAN day off : Friday has been disable to choose)
- Blog section for user comment about their experience of Aroot Beauty
- Question section for users to ensure from the services
- Full Authentication cycle

If you found any bug or better solution for a 
Reservation system like this, send a comment for me.

If you want to run this project on local server, please, first fill up some settings in settings.py file like SECRET_KEY, DEBUG and rest of them.

I will add Rest framework to it and I will
turn it to REST API, in few months later, till than,
It's just a simple web application with Django.

I hope that it will become my first project on the live server.
