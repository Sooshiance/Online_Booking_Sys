If you want to run this project on local server, please, first fill up some settings in settings.py file like SECRET_KEY, DEBUG and rest of them.

I will add Rest framework to it and I will
turn it to REST API, in few months later, till than,
It's just a simple web application with Django.

I hope that it will become my first project on the live server.
